Moved by the unsafe water conditions in rural India, he developed **AquaSentinel**, an *IoT-powered* system that monitors water quality in real time.  

Driven by *purpose*, *curiosity*, and **दिल से देश के लिए कुछ करने का जुनून**, Harshit is proving that **innovation has no age**.

This model excels at handling complex data patterns like those in water quality parameters—pH, turbidity, TDS, and conductivity. The result? Faster insights, smarter predictions, and truly actionable alerts")
